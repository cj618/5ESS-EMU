NAME
     5ESS – minimal AT&T 5ESS craft / RC/V / SCC emulator

SYNOPSIS
     perl 5ESS.pl

DESCRIPTION
     5ESS is an interactive terminal-based emulator that simulates a small,
     operator-facing subset of the AT&T 5ESS Electronic Switching System.
     It focuses on craft-shell behaviour, RC/V menu workflows, alarms,
     MCC page display, SCC monitoring stubs, and minimal persistence.

     The emulator is single-user and single-process, but supports multiple
     logical channels (MCC, RC/V, SCC, TEST) with channel-scoped behaviour.
     Hardware switching and real call processing are not implemented.

     The system persists state across restarts using a DMERT-like filesystem
     rooted at ./rclog.

STARTUP
     On startup, the program:

     1. Prints a Message of the Day from etc/motd.dat
     2. Loads persistent state from ./rclog/state.json
        - If missing, initializes default state
        - If invalid, resets state and saves defaults
     3. Prompts for channel selection
     4. Creates a session bound to the chosen channel
     5. Enters the craft shell or SCC loop

CHANNELS
     A session is bound to exactly one channel. Channels cannot be changed
     without restarting the program.

     MCC
         Master Control Center (stub). Uses craft shell. Supports MCC page
         commands and OP/ALM queries.

     RC/V Local
         Local Recent Change and Verify terminal. Default channel.
         Supports RC/V menu access and provisioning.

     RC/V Remote
         Remote RC/V terminal. Currently behaves the same as RC/V Local.

     SCC
         Switching Control Center. Passive monitoring channel. Receives
         unsolicited event output and blocks RC changes.

     TEST
         Test channel (stub). Exists for future expansion.

SESSION MODES
     Within a channel, a session can operate in one of several modes:

     CRAFT
         Default mode. Prompt is "< ".
         Accepts craft commands and allows entry into RC/V menu mode.

     RCV_MENU
         RC/V menu system. Prompt is "RC/V> ".
         Allows line assignment, DN assignment, and verify.

     SCC
         SCC monitoring mode. Prompt is "SCC> ".
         Accepts limited OP queries and prints unsolicited events.

PROMPTS
     <       Craft shell
     RC/V>   RC/V menu
     SCC>    Switching Control Center

FILES
     ./rclog/
         DMERT-like persistence directory.

     ./rclog/state.json
         JSON snapshot of emulator state.

     ./rclog/journal.log
         Append-only log recording state save events.

     etc/motd.dat
         Message of the Day displayed at startup.

COMMANDS
     See in-program HELP for full command listing.

LIMITATIONS
     This emulator does not implement real call processing, hardware,
     billing, or OSS integration. It is intended as a behavioural scaffold.
